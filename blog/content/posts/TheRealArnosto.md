## Description

The Real Arnosto:

 - is about 5' tall
 - has bushy black hair
 - has a beard that keeps growing back, no matter how often he shaves
 - has bare feet, which is not uncommon in these parts
 - has hazel eyes
 - sports a minimal smile, in fact it is probably a quarter of a smirk; the only way to tell if he is happy is if you can see a sparkle in his eyes
