Up north of TenKeep, somewhere near La Gama, a cloud giant was angry.

After the massacre at Silo Verde, the footpad Al Shieff felt an emptiness in his stomach before the throbbing from an oozy place on his head. Looked like everyone was playing dead.

Night fell. With an early moon, Al got up. He saw lights further east. "La Gama," he thought. Several boring hours later, he reached the town.

Hunger driven, somnambulistically, he crept beside an adobe house. No one would notice.

[Move silently, 25%, rolls a 27]  Somebody's dog comes-out jawing. [Dog's reaction roll, 2d6, rolls a 5, "unfriendly, may attack"]. [Initiative, damn dog gets the jump. Lunges [attack roll d20, rolls an 18, hits, damage, d3, rolls a 6]. Al tears away. Runs to a hollow. Fido turns back.

Hungry Al slinks around a leafy field. Says, "Something's got to be here, something - a  f#^^ing farm! Al Shieff falls asleep. Now, the night is as dark as night.

Somewhere near La Gama, Al lights a torch.

[Wandering Monster roll, 2-in-6, rolls a 2] [Wilderness wandering monster in desert, d8, rolls an 8, "human"] [Wilderness encounters for human, d12, rolls a 6, "High-Level Magic User]. Further: [Surprise roll for wilderness encounters: Al, d6, rolls a 2, Magic User, d6 rolls a 4; Distance between parties, 4d6 x 10, 100 yards.] Thus:

A 10th-level magic user, reflecting on his new Dimension Door scroll, eased through the cool, night air...

Al Shieff hurried across a garden, stole onions and a cabbage, then (unaware) hurried back, to the low point where the red-clad magic user rested. Al considered running [but he was surprised]. He felt his longsword [still surprised]. Then, he listened to the voice of the magic user's dagger. 

Al accepted the dagger's offer for a night walk with the magic user. They climbed to a starry ledge. Al ate rabbit and onions, said he'd fought at Silo Verde. Said he'd seen no aberrations. 

"One more thing," the magic user stated. He cast "charm person" [Al's saving throw, d20, needed a 15 and rolled a 1].

Al agreed, in the morning he'd head down to La Gama. "Sure, no problem, I'll drop-in Vuida's Inn, see what's new, and meet you here tomorrow."
